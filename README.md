# TECHVER
This is the model verification repository. 

The example of an application is already on the repository. This will be updated further and with other elaborated examples. 

When you are conducting black-box tests, if you identify an error, it might be beneficial to correct that error first, before you proceed to the next black-box test (otherwise that identified error can cause the model fail the next black-box test, as well).
