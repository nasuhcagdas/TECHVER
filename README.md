# TECHVER
This is the model verification repository. 

An application example is uploaded on the repository. This example will be updated further and with other elaborated examples. 

When you are conducting black-box tests, if you identify an error, it might be beneficial to correct that error first, before you proceed to the next black-box test (otherwise that identified error can cause the model fail the next black-box test, as well). 

The transparent documentation of the reproducible tests is key for the credibility and provides efficiency when multiple people are involved. Hence, please not only describe the tests you conducted, but also give specifications how someone else can reproduce the results you obtained. 

If you want to upload your examples/ tips and tricks and questions and comments, you can try to upload here, or send an email to: nasuhcagdas@gmail.com
